# This Guide Assumes

This guide is designed for developers who have at least basic knowlege in [PHP](http://php.net) and databases like [MySQL](http://mysql.com). This guide assumes that you have the following:

* Apache and PHP installed
* Database software installed (ex: MySQL) 

It is recommended to familiarize yourself with PHP first before diving into Kohana. You will find it much easier to follow what's going on with your Kohana application if you understand basic PHP syntax. There are some good free resources on the internet for learning PHP such as:

* [W3Schools PHP Tutorial](http://www.w3schools.com/php/)
* [Tizag PHP Tutorial](http://www.tizag.com/phpT/)
* [PHP Manual](http://php.net/manual/en/)
