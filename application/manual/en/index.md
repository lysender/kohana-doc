# Kohana Unofficial Documentation

Welcome and warning. This is an unofficial documentation for [Kohana Framework](http://kohanaframework.org). This documentation is not written to replace the [Kohana's official documentation](http://kohanaframework.org/guide), nor to become an alternative to Kohana's [Unofficial Wiki](http://kerkness.ca/wiki/doku.php). This is written primarily to gain personal experience in creating documentations in general and it happens that Kohana Framework is such an interesting topic. 

[!!] Disclaimer: All contents are mostly from my personal opinion and does not represent the Kohana Framework and the Kohana Team.

Most of the contents are derived from the online resources such as the official documentation, the unofficial wiki, blog posts and forum discussions.
