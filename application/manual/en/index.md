# Kohana Unofficial Documentation

Welcome and warning. This is an unofficial documentation for [Kohana PHP Framework](http://kohanaframework.org). Since English is not my primary language, you may find gramatical and spelling errors on pages of this site. I apologize in for that. Please report related errors if you found one.

## Disclaimer:

This documentation is written not to replace the [Kohana's official documentation](http://kohanaframework.org/guide), nor to become an alternative to Kohana's [Unofficial Wiki](http://kerkness.ca/wiki/doku.php). This is written primarily just as a test bed for learning the framework as a personal development and nothing more. However, I grab most of the documentations from the online resources such as the officla documentation and the unofficial wiki.
