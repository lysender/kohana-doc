# Kohana Core Reference

Kohana provides a minimal set of classes for the core of the framework which can help you build web applications quickly with minimal footprint. All classes follow the [cascading filesystem](learn.filesystem) pattern which extends the core with 1 exception: the `Kohana` class which extends `Kohana_Core`.
